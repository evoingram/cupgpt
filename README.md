# CupGPT Coding Monkey Wizard

## Project Overview

This project is a ChatGPT prompt generator for coding, programming, and computer science-themed inquiries, with a backend built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and a frontend built with React. The backend provides a RESTful API for managing coding topics, content, and examples, while the frontend allows users to search and interact with this content.

CupGPT Coding Monkey Wizard helps developers and students by generating high-quality ChatGPT prompts tailored for coding and programming inquiries. This tool uses your study notes to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of ChatGPT responses, saving time and improving the overall learning and development experience.

## Key Features

- RESTful API with CRUD operations for coding topics, content, and examples
- Search functionality to make ChatGPT queries more productive
- CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication
- Checkboxes to customize output prompt, including options for bulleted list formatting, accuracy, including sources, writing style, and up-to-date information
- Tip window to help the user write better queries
- Tooltips on checkboxes to describe their functionality

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Knex
- **Frontend**: React, Axios
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Available Scripts

### Docker Commands

- `docker-compose up --build`: Builds and starts the backend, frontend, and database services
- `docker-compose down`: Stops the backend, frontend, and database services
- `docker volume prune -f`: Removes Docker volumes to reset the database

## Testing

- **Backend**: Jest
- **Frontend**: Cypress
